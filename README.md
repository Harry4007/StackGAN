# Generating Photorealistic Images from StackGAN

This repository implements the paper StackGAN: Text to Photo-realistic Image Synthesis with Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks by Han Zhang, Tao Xu, Hongsheng Li, Shaoting Zhang, Xiaogang Wang, Xiaolei Huang, and Dimitris Metaxas. The project focuses on generating photo-realistic images from text descriptions using a two-stage Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).
